# Software Test Engineer - Live Coding

## About The Exercise

- Time allotted for the live coding exercise is the first 30 minutes of the Top Grading interview.
- You will be given a document / link that explains the coding question in detail and the expected result.
- The exercise will be about testing an API endpoint's response and writing assertions.
- Your entire screen will be shared with us the whole time.
- You should be able to write your code, execute it and show the output on your screen.

## Your Setup (Do This Before The Interview)

- You're expected to have the necessary setup on your own computer before the challenge starts. This will allow you to be in your usual, comfortable environment.
- At Hello Chef, our weapon of choice for end to end and UI tests is Javascript. So it would be great to see you using the same for this challenge.
- But if you're a total stranger to Javascript, you may use another language of your choice.
- You can use any framework that's fit for API testing purposes.
- Before the interview begins, please have a brand new project with the framework of your choice ready & fired up.
- Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies or packages installed (e.g. Node.js, NVM, NPM, yarn, etc).
- You can use any code editor of your choice.
- You're free to look up syntax / function reference online during the interview.
